# My Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains machine learning projects focused on various prediction tasks using simple regression and classification techniques. Each project includes the dataset, a Jupyter notebook with the analysis and model implementation.

## Projects

1. **Titanic Survival Prediction**
   - **Description**: This project uses a dataset of Titanic passengers to predict whether a person can survive or not based on various factors.

2. **Click on Advertisement Prediction**
   - **Description**: This project uses the Fake advertising  dataset to predict the whether a person clicks on advertisement or not based on its features.

## Getting Started

To run the projects locally, clone the repository and navigate to the respective project folder. Open the Jupyter notebook (`.ipynb` file) to see the analysis and model implementation.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Danishyousuf19/Simple-Linear-Regression.git
